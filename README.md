Severe sepsis and septic shock treatment - antibiotics optimization (under construction)
============================================
A living systematic review

Short url: http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/sepsis/

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that clinical intervention *is* effective. Heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> was '[substantial](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at 86%. The heterogeneity may be due to varying levels of patient acuity across studies as reflected in differing levels of mean lactic acid and age in the cohorts. Heterogeneity may also be due to varying cutoffs across studies for defining rapid adminstration of fluids. This review updates previously published meta-analysis(es).

Subgroup analysis suggested a trend that was insignificant.
