Severe sepsis and septic shock treatment with fluids
============================================
A living systematic review

Short url: http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/sepsis/

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that clinical intervention *is* effective. Heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> was '[substantial](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at 79%. The heterogeneity may be due to the study by Seymour excluding patients with long delaying in completion of fluids. This review updates previously published meta-analysis(es).(citation[s] below)

Meta-regression of common modulators (year of publication, study size, event rate in the control groups) finds that the outcome of the intervention is effected by xx.

**Methods overview:** This repository is an [openMetaAnalysis](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/) that combines methods of scoping, rapid, and living systematic reviews.  This analysis updates one or more previously published review(s) below. A comparison of studies included in this review compared to prior reviews are in the table, [reconciliation of trials included with prior meta-analyses/](files/reconciliation-tables/Reconciliation%20of%20studies.pdf). Newer studies included are listed in the references below. Rationale for newer trials excluded may be listed at the end of the references.
