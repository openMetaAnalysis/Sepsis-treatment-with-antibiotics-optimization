## Inclusion criteria
We developed inclusion criteria using the methods of a scoping review in which "Study selection involves post hoc inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria are based on the specifics of the research question and on new familiarity with the subject matter through reading the studies" (Levac et al, Implement Sci 2010 PMID [20854677](http://pubmed.gov/20854677)).

We included cohort studies that reported:

One of the following outcomes:
* The adjusted odds ratio (with 95% CI) of survival or death 
* Adjusted hazard ratio or restricted mean survival time (RMST, PMID [32203984](http://pubmed.gov/32203984)) (with 95% CI) for length of hospital or ICU stay

We considered addressing the following questions/exposures and chose to focus on the first question only:
* Speed of starting fluids
  * Fluids started with a specified interval (eg, 30 or 60 minutes) versus longer. Example: Leisman, Ann Emerg Med 2016 PMID [27085369](http://pubmed.gov/27085369)
  * Odds ratio for each hour of delay for starting. Example: Leisman, Crit Care Med 2017 PMID [28671898](http://pubmed.gov/28671898)
Not addressed in this review
* Speed of completing 30 ml/kg
  * Completing within a specified time interval (eg, 3 or 6 hours). Example: Kuttab, Crit Care Med 2020 PMID [31393324](http://pubmed.gov/31393324)
  * Odds ratio for each hour of delay in completing. Example, Seymour. NEJM 2017 (see top row of figure S4 in the supplement) PMID [28528569](http://pubmed.gov/28528569)
* Speed of infusion
  * The adjusted odds ratio of survival or death after stratifying by a speed. Example stratifying at 0.25 ml/kg/min overl 30 ml/kg as cutoff: Hu, Critical Care 2020 PMID [32264936](http://pubmed.gov/32264936)
* Volume of infusion
  * The adjusted odds ratio of survival or death per volumen infused over a specified interval (eg, 1, 3, or 6 hours). Example: Lee, Chest 2014 PMID [24853382](http://pubmed.gov/24853382)
* Other analysis
  * The adjusted odds ratio of survival or death per proportion of total fluid received within for 3 hours. Example: Lee, Chest 2014 PMID [24853382](http://pubmed.gov/24853382)
