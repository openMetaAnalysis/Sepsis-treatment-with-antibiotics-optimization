Notes:
Madaline. This was a before-after cohort study and so should have less bias than the other cohorts in which hospitalists 
made their own decisions to de-escalate.
Rashidzada. This RCT used an antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) team of an ID consultant and a pharmacist.  
The team could also recommend a formal ID consult.
